We have made a website on which user registers and they get unique payment id.
Names of shops are displayed on the home page along with their unique payment id. The customer just has to click on the button and enter the amount.This will redirect them to Dapp made using celo and making their payment successful.
Next question that could pop into your mind is why celo?
Celo is not only fast, transparent and secure but it also builds trust among users.
